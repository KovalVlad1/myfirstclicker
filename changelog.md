Well i continued it and i did something good even with zero html and css skills, it's really impressive and i really should learn them both later.
There a really much things which i should do, and which i dont know how to do. Also i tried to add icons for buttons but when you buying upgrades it disappears, i should to link it somehow...

18.12.2022 | My 1st Clicker 0.0. Null Update (Codename: NULL):
- NEW MECHANIC! You need to clicking on the button for gaining coins
- NEW 2 UPGRADES! First increases coin per click by 1, second increases bonus of first one by 10%
- Some bugs like you sometimes cant get bonus from 2nd upgrade. Idk why.

This is a first game made by me from scratch, and i spent for it a some time. Well it's actually my second game, but that first made it's just mod.
Idk if i want to continue it.
